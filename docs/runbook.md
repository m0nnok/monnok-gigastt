# Runbook

Operator-facing guidance for gigastt in production. Focuses on the new v0.9.0 shutdown + session-cap surface (V1-03 / V1-04) and how to roll back cleanly when rollout breaks clients.

## At a glance

| Symptom | First check | Escape hatch |
|---|---|---|
| Clients lose `Final` on deploy | Drain window too short: check `shutdown_drain_secs` vs your orchestrator's grace period | Increase `GIGASTT_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_SECS` OR disable WS tracking via `--shutdown-drain-secs 0` (clamped to 1 s) |
| Clients receive spurious `max_session_duration_exceeded` | Legitimate long sessions | Raise `GIGASTT_MAX_SESSION_SECS` (default 3600) or set `0` to disable |
| SIGTERM takes 30+ seconds to exit | In-flight spawn_blocking inferences can't be cancelled mid-chunk | Wait or lower `GIGASTT_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_SECS`; process will still finish the current chunk |
| `Close(1008 Policy Violation)` unexpected | V1-04 cap fired | Double check `max_session_secs` is set high enough for your use case |
| `Close(1001 Going Away)` seen by clients | Expected on SIGTERM — not a bug | None — clients should reconnect |

## V1-03 graceful drain

When the server receives `SIGTERM` (or the `run_with_shutdown` oneshot fires):

1. A process-wide `CancellationToken` is cancelled.
2. Every live `handle_ws_inner` session sees `cancel.cancelled()` in its `biased;` select loop, flushes its streaming state, emits a (possibly empty) `Final`, and closes with `Close(1001 Going Away)`.
3. SSE `/v1/transcribe/stream` tasks check the token between chunks and drop the channel sender, which terminates the SSE stream from the client's perspective.
4. After `axum::serve` returns, the main task waits up to `shutdown_drain_secs` seconds for the `TaskTracker` to report all tracked WS / SSE futures complete.
5. If the drain window expires with tracked tasks still running, a WARN is emitted (`Drain window expired with tracked tasks still running`) and the process exits anyway.

### Rollback: disable graceful drain

If v0.9.0 rollout breaks WS clients, the runtime supports a tiered rollback:

1. **Shrink the drain window to 1 s** (effectively disabling the wait):
   ```sh
   gigastt serve --shutdown-drain-secs 0
   # or: GIGASTT_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_SECS=0 gigastt serve
   ```
   Note: `0` is internally clamped to `1` second. The cancel + Final path still fires, but the process won't wait longer than 1 s before exiting.

2. **Disable the session cap independently** (see V1-04 below).

3. **Git revert** — v0.9.0's WS-lifecycle work lives in one PR and reverts cleanly. Only use if options 1-2 are insufficient; you'll need to re-cut the release.

## V1-04 max session duration

`idle_timeout` is reset on every frame, so a silence-streaming client could hold a `SessionTriplet` forever. `max_session_secs` is a *wall-clock* deadline that fires regardless of frame activity.

On cap expiry the server sends:
1. `ServerMessage::Error { message: "Maximum session duration exceeded", code: "max_session_duration_exceeded" }`
2. A best-effort `Final` frame (empty if no text accumulated).
3. `Close(1008 Policy Violation)`.

Overshoot ≤ 500 ms in the common case — a chunk that was already in flight when the deadline expired finishes first, then the loop hits the deadline branch on the next iteration.

### Rollback: disable the session cap

```sh
gigastt serve --max-session-secs 0
# or: GIGASTT_MAX_SESSION_SECS=0 gigastt serve
```

`0` parks the deadline at `u64::MAX / 2`, so `sleep_until` never fires. The session then runs as long as the idle timeout allows (default 300 s of silence).

### Config pitfalls

- If you set `--max-session-secs` *below* `--idle-timeout-secs`, the cap will always fire before the idle timer can apply. The server emits a `warn` at startup flagging this as a likely misconfiguration but does not refuse to start.
- Caps smaller than your typical transcription window will produce noisy `max_session_duration_exceeded` errors for legitimate clients.

## Metrics

`gigastt_http_requests_total{path="/v1/ws",status="503"}` with code `shutting_down` in the body is the signal that upgrades are being rejected because shutdown was already in flight. Usually correlated with `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` being shorter than `shutdown_drain_secs`.

(Counter for cancelled-WS by reason is tracked separately — see `specs/prod-readiness-v1.0.md` V1-30.)

## On-call triage checklist

1. Pull a WS trace from the affected client. Confirm presence (or absence) of `Final` and the `Close` code.
2. Check server logs for `Shutdown signalled`, `Session cap reached`, or `Drain window expired`.
3. Confirm orchestrator `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` ≥ `shutdown_drain_secs + 5` (see `docs/deployment.md`).
4. If clients are seeing unexpected 503 `shutting_down`, the proxy LB may still be routing traffic after the pod started draining — add a `preStop` sleep to the k8s manifest so the LB deregisters the pod before the app sees `SIGTERM`.
5. If the cap is firing for legitimate long sessions, raise it — there's no correctness downside to `max_session_secs = 14400` (4 h), only a weaker guarantee against wedged sessions.
