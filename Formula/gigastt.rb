    <<~EOS
      The GigaAM v3 model (~850 MB) is downloaded on first run into
      ~/.gigastt/models. An INT8-quantized encoder is produced automatically
      (~2 min one-time). Disable with `--skip-quantize` or
      `GIGASTT_SKIP_QUANTIZE=1`.

      Quick start:
        gigastt download         # fetches model + quantizes
        gigastt serve            # starts STT server on 127.0.0.1:9876
