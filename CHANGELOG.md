## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Long-audio support (up to 65 minutes by default).** `--max-audio-duration-s`
  / `GIGASTT_MAX_AUDIO_DURATION_S` replaces the hardcoded 10-minute cap, which
  had been rejecting 25–30 minute recordings with a misleading 422 that blamed
  the audio format.
- **`--max-inference-secs`** (default 1800) — wall-clock budget for a single
  transcription, checked cooperatively at chunk boundaries so the session
  triplet is always returned to the pool. Exceeding it returns
  504 `inference_timeout`.
- **`--max-concurrent-uploads`** (default `pool_size * 2`) — admission control
  for `/v1/transcribe*`. The pool bounds concurrent *inference*, but axum
  buffers each request body whole before the handler runs, so this is what
  bounds peak memory. Rejections return 503 + `Retry-After`.
- **`GET /v1/models`** now reports `max_audio_duration_s` and `max_body_bytes`
  so clients can check a file locally instead of uploading it to find out.
- **Diarization instrumentation** — `offline_diarization` log line with
  `elapsed_ms`, `rtf`, turn/segment counts and RSS delta, plus
  `gigastt_audio_duration_seconds` and
  `gigastt_upload_admission_rejections_total` metrics.

### Changed

- **`--body-limit-bytes` default raised 50 MiB → 256 MiB.** Covers an hour of
  compressed audio (320 kbps ≈ 137 MiB) or 16 kHz mono WAV (≈ 110 MiB).
  Uncompressed 48 kHz stereo (≈ 659 MiB/hour) is deliberately not covered.
- **`--pool-checkout-timeout-secs` default raised 30 → 300.** With long files
  holding sessions for tens of minutes, 30 s returned 503 whenever the server
  was merely busy.
- **`/v1/transcribe` error codes are now specific.** Previously every engine
  failure collapsed into 422 `transcription_error`. Now: 422 `audio_too_long`
  (with the observed length and the configured limit), 422 `invalid_audio`,
  500 `inference_error`, 504 `inference_timeout`. Inference failures moving
  from 422 to 500 is a behaviour change. Client-facing messages never echo the
  underlying error chain, which can carry filesystem paths.
- **`/v1/transcribe/stream`** applies the same classification and honours the
  server's configured duration cap.

### Fixed

- **Decode no longer buffers the whole file at its source sample rate.**
  Resampling now runs in fixed 32 KiB windows during the packet loop, so only
  the 16 kHz result is held whole. Peak memory for an hour of 48 kHz stereo
  drops from ~2.7 GB to ~231 MB and no longer scales with the source rate.
  The `n_frames` capacity hint is clamped rather than discarded for long files,
  removing the doubling-realloc spike.
- **Word timestamp drift on chunked (>30 s) transcription.** `frame_offset` was
  accumulated from a per-chunk estimate that ran one encoder frame short, losing
  40 ms per 20 s chunk — about 7 s over an hour, which also misaligned words
  against diarization turns. It is now anchored to the absolute sample position.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- **polyvoice** dependency bumped from `0.4.3` to `0.5.2` (VAD, AHC
  clustering, DER evaluation, CLI tooling; no API changes for gigastt).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-06

First stable release. All P0 blockers and P1 ship-before-v1.0 items from the
production-readiness review are closed. Public API (REST, WebSocket, CLI) is
now covered by semver guarantees.

### Added

- **Configurable pool checkout timeout** — `--pool-checkout-timeout-secs`
  (env `GIGASTT_POOL_CHECKOUT_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 30). `Retry-After`
  headers and `retry_after_ms` JSON fields derive from the same value.
- **WebSocket protocol version negotiation** — `Configure` accepts an
  optional `protocol_version` field; the server rejects unsupported versions
  with error code `unsupported_protocol_version`. `Ready` includes
  `min_protocol_version` for client-side discovery.
- **Extended Prometheus metrics** — `gigastt_pool_available` (gauge),
  `gigastt_pool_checkout_duration_seconds` (histogram),
  `gigastt_pool_timeouts_total` (counter), `gigastt_ws_active_connections`
  (gauge), `gigastt_inference_duration_seconds` (histogram),
  `gigastt_rate_limit_rejections_total` (counter).
- **`SECURITY.md`** — responsible disclosure policy (90-day timeline).
- **`docs/privacy.md`** — auditable privacy-first claim documentation.
- **`docs/observability/`** — example Prometheus alerting rules and a
  starter Grafana dashboard JSON.
- **`cargo-semver-checks`** in CI — catches accidental breaking changes on PRs.
- **`cargo-tarpaulin`** coverage job — uploads to Codecov on main push.

### Changed

- **Idle timeout e2e test** uses a 3 s server-side timeout instead of the
  default 300 s, reducing wall-clock from ~310 s to ~5 s.

### Removed

- **`POOL_RETRY_AFTER_MS` / `POOL_RETRY_AFTER_SECS` constants** — replaced
  by functions that derive the hint from `pool_checkout_timeout_secs`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-05

Speaker diarization is now a default feature powered by the polyvoice crate
from crates.io. Breaking CLI change: `--diarization` replaced by `--skip-diarization`.

### Changed

- **Diarization default feature** — `diarization` added to default Cargo features;
  speaker model downloads automatically with `gigastt download`.
- **polyvoice from crates.io** — replaced local path dependency (`../polyvoice`)
  with published `polyvoice = "0.4.3"` from crates.io.
- **CLI flag renamed** — `gigastt download --diarization` replaced by
  `gigastt download --skip-diarization` (opt-out instead of opt-in).
- **API adaptation** — `DiarizationConfig` uses `SampleRate` wrapper type and
  explicit `max_gap_secs` field to match polyvoice 0.4.3 API.

### Removed

- **In-tree diarization module** (`src/inference/diarization.rs`) — `SpeakerEncoder`,
  `SpeakerCluster`, and `cosine_similarity` replaced by polyvoice's
  `OnnxEmbeddingExtractor`, `OnlineDiarizer`, and `OfflineDiarizer`.

### Fixed

- Duplicate `tokens.is_empty()` guard in `tokens_to_words`.
- Stale `diarization.rs` references in CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md.
- Magic numbers in `OnnxEmbeddingExtractor::new()` extracted to named constants.
- `text` assembly in `transcribe_samples` moved after diarization annotation.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-05-04

Performance, security, and DX improvements. Internal refactor with no breaking
changes to the REST, WebSocket, or CLI public APIs.

### Added

- **OpenAPI REST spec** (`docs/openapi.yaml`) — documents `/health`, `/v1/models`,
  `/v1/transcribe`, `/v1/transcribe/stream`, and `/metrics` endpoints.
- **Reusable inference buffers** — mel spectrogram FFT/power buffers cached in
  `StreamingState`; joiner logits buffer reused across decode steps. Reduces
  per-chunk allocations by ~60 % in the streaming hot path.
- **Zero-allocation token cleaning** — `tokens_to_words` no longer allocates a
  temporary `String` for every BPE token.
- **`FeatureExtractor`** and **`TranscriptAssembler`** — extracted from `Engine`
  to reduce god-object surface area. `Engine` now coordinates loading and inference
  while sub-components own signal processing and transcript assembly.
- **CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) routes** and `Vary: Origin` header — compliant
  with CORS complex-request requirements.
- **Per-IP rate limiter trust-proxy toggle** — `extract_client_ip` no longer
  reads `X-Forwarded-For` unless explicitly trusted, closing the IP-spoofing
  vector for deployments behind reverse proxies.
- **CPU EP thread limits** — `intra_threads(1)` + `inter_threads(1)` for the
  CPU execution provider, preventing ORT thread oversubscription on multi-core
  hosts.
- **Cached resampler** (`resample_with_cache`) — `SincFixedIn` instance reused
  across WebSocket chunks for the same connection.
- **WER gate in benchmark suite** — `tests/benchmark.rs` asserts `wer < 12.0`
  so regressions fail CI.
- **E2E zero-port testing** — `run_with_config_listener` accepts a pre-bound
  `TcpListener`, eliminating the TOCTOU race in `tests/common/mod.rs`.

### Changed

- **WebSocket examples** (`examples/*`) migrated to canonical `/v1/ws` path,
  added `ready`-wait and explicit `stop` signal.
- **`GigasttError`** refactored from string-based enum to `thiserror` struct
  variants with typed `source` chains. Improves programmatic error handling
  and preserves causal chains across the FFI boundary.
- **PII sanitization** — inference logs now emit token/word counts and audio
  duration instead of raw transcript text.

### Fixed

- **Pool deadlock** — reverted `Pool<T>` back to `async-channel` (the partial
  `tokio::sync::mpsc` migration deadlocked `close()` vs `blocking_recv()`).
- **`soak.yml`** stdout redirect and artifact retention fixed.
- **CI** migrated to `nextest` for faster, more reliable unit-test runs.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-04-23

Production-hardening release: security fix, Android FFI support, and lean builds.

### Security

- **RUSTSEC-2026-0104** — `rustls-webpki` 0.103.12 → 0.103.13. Reachable panic in CRL parsing fixed.

### Added

- **Android FFI layer** (`src/ffi.rs`, feature `ffi`). C-ABI exports:
  `gigastt_engine_new`, `gigastt_engine_new_with_pool_size`,
  `gigastt_transcribe_file`, `gigastt_stream_new`,
  `gigastt_stream_process_chunk`, `gigastt_stream_flush`,
  `gigastt_stream_free`, `gigastt_string_free`, `gigastt_engine_free`.
  Enables embedding gigastt as `libgigastt.so` in Android apps.
- **`ort/nnapi`** via feature `ffi` — Android NPU/DSP acceleration when available.
- **`Pool::checkout_blocking()`** — synchronous pool checkout for FFI callers.
- **`Serialize` derive on `TranscriptSegment`** — JSON serialization for FFI streaming.
- **Android default pool size = 1** — reduces mobile RSS from ~560 MB to ~350 MB.
- **`server` Cargo feature** (enabled by default) — gates `axum`, `tokio-stream`,
  `tokio-util`. Building `--no-default-features --features ffi` strips server
  dead code from mobile `.so` binaries.
- **Binary target** (`gigastt` bin) requires `server` feature via
  `required-features` in `Cargo.toml`.
- **Android CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/android.yml`) — builds
  `libgigastt.so` for `arm64-v8a` on every PR/push.

### Changed

- **README refactor** — added terminal demo block, Troubleshooting section,
  HTTP error codes table, extracted full CLI reference to `docs/cli.md`,
  fixed "unlimited concurrent" comparison, added Contributing link.

### Fixed

- Clippy warnings: `clippy::single_match`, `clippy::items_after_test_module`,
  `clippy::manual_is_multiple_of`.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-21

Dependency-bump rollup. No functional source changes; every entry here is
a Dependabot PR that landed green on the polish-green main from 0.9.3.

### Dependencies

- `reqwest` 0.12.28 → 0.13.2 (new TLS backend pulls `aws-lc-rs`).
- `prost-build` 0.13.5 → 0.14.3 (`petgraph` 0.7 → 0.8 transitively).
- `axum` 0.8.8 → 0.8.9 + `tokio-tungstenite` 0.28 → 0.29 in dev-deps
  (wire-protocol unchanged).
- `tokio`-ecosystem group bump (tokio + tokio-* minors).

### CI / workflow actions

- `actions/checkout` 4 → 6 across ci.yml, release.yml, soak.yml, homebrew.yml.
- `actions/upload-artifact` 4 → 7 in release.yml, soak.yml.
- `actions/attest-build-provenance` 3 → 4 in release.yml.
- `softprops/action-gh-release` 2 → 3 in release.yml.

### Not landed

- `rubato` 0.16 → 2.0 (Dependabot PR #9) closed: the 2.0 release removes
  `SincFixedIn` in favour of a new `audioadapter` API; migrating
  `src/inference/audio.rs::resample` is a code change Dependabot can't
  generate automatically. Pinned at 0.16.2 until someone ports the
  resampler.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-21

Polish-before-production release. No functional behaviour changes for existing
clients; server, CLI, REST, and WebSocket surfaces are wire-compatible with
v0.9.2. Dockerfile was broken since v0.9.0 — this release fixes it.

### Fixed

- **Docker images now actually build** (`Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.cuda`). Both
  builders gained `protobuf-compiler` (required by `build.rs` since v0.9.0's
  `prost-build` migration) and now `COPY proto/` + `build.rs` before `src/`.
  The 0.9.0 / 0.9.1 / 0.9.2 images failed at `cargo build` with
  `prost-build failed to compile proto/onnx.proto`; the published Docker
  recipes in README only worked if the reader had protoc in their base image.
- **`tests/e2e_rest.rs::test_rest_large_body_rss_within_budget` removed.** The
  test asserted `RSS_after - RSS_before < wav.len() * 3 + 40 MiB` after
  POSTing a 300 s WAV. Every main-push CI run since v0.9.0 observed a delta
  of ~320 MiB regardless of whether the REST upload path was zero-copy or
  4×-copy, because ONNX Runtime's encoder scratch for 5 minutes of 16 kHz
  audio allocates ~90+ MiB by itself. The test could neither catch the
  V1-05 regression it was designed for nor pass reliably. The zero-copy
  contract is covered by the `BytesMediaSource` impl in
  `src/inference/audio.rs` and the unit tests around it.
- **`src/inference/tokenizer.rs`**: skip vocab lines that parse as a bare
  integer (e.g. a legacy `1025\n` size header). Such a line has no trailing
  id column, so the existing `rfind([' ', '\t'])` fallback would push the
  integer string as a ghost token and poison the ID space.
- **`src/server/metrics.rs::fmt_f64_prom`**: drop the empty-body
  `if v == v.trunc() && v.abs() < 1e15 { }` branch that existed only to
  document that it was a no-op. The `format!("{v}")` tail always ran.

### Changed

- **`Engine::transcribe_file` / `transcribe_bytes_shared` share a
  `transcribe_samples(&[f32], &mut SessionTriplet)` tail.** Previously the
  two bodies duplicated the mel → encoder → decode → word-join sequence
  byte-for-byte. Same public API, same behaviour, one implementation.
- **`src/server/mod.rs`**: `MAX_RPM` clamp + warn moved into
  `RateLimiter::new`; the startup log line calls `limiter.interval_ms()`
  instead of duplicating the math. Dropped the write-only
  `RateLimiter::last_evict_ms` field — eviction already runs on a tokio
  interval, nothing read the stored timestamp. Exposed the public
  constant `server::rate_limit::MAX_RPM` (= 60 000) for external callers.
- **`src/server/mod.rs`**: single source of truth for `SUPPORTED_RATES`
  (`pub(crate)`). The REST `/v1/models` handler used to inline
  `vec![8000, 16000, 24000, 44100, 48000]` — it now reuses the same
  const the WS `Ready` payload reads (V1-34).
- **`src/server/http.rs`**: `vocab_size` in `/v1/models` comes from
  `engine.vocab_size()` (new public `Engine::vocab_size()`), not a `1025`
  literal. If the upstream model rev ever resizes its BPE vocabulary the
  REST surface no longer lies.
- **`src/model/mod.rs`**: extracted `stream_to_partial_then_finalize(url,
  final_dest, expected_sha256, label)`. The per-file GigaAM download
  loop and the single-file speaker-diarization download now share one
  implementation of URL fetch, progress, stream-to-partial, and
  SHA-256 + atomic-rename finalize. Drops ~50 duplicated lines.
- **`src/quantize.rs`**: staging file suffix switched from `.onnx.tmp` to
  `.partial` so the in-tree INT8 quantizer uses the same convention as
  the HuggingFace download pipeline in `src/model/mod.rs`.
- **`tests/server_integration.rs` removed** (367 LoC, 6 tests). Every case
  is covered by the v0.4.3+ `tests/e2e_ws.rs` / `tests/e2e_rest.rs` /
  `tests/load_test.rs` suites; the legacy file used `sleep(200ms)` race
  gates and the long-deprecated `server::run(engine, port, host)`
  signature (V1-23).
- **Deprecation headers on `/ws`**: the upgrade response now carries
  RFC 8594 `Deprecation: true` plus `Link: </v1/ws>; rel="successor-version"`
  so client libraries can surface the migration warning before v1.0
  drops the alias. Server-side warn log was already in place (V1-14).
- **Docs + specs housekeeping:**
  - `specs/design-v1.0-{pool-and-rate-limit,rest-streaming,ws-lifecycle}.md`
    → `specs/archive/design-v1.0/` (all three shipped in v0.9.0-rc.1).
  - `docs/superpowers/` (v0.4 pre-ship plans) → `docs/archive/superpowers-v0.4/`.
  - `missions/gigastt-wer/` scratchpad deleted.
  - `specs/prod-readiness-v1.0.md` now carries a v0.9.0 rollup banner
    listing the closed IDs; detail rows left for historical trail.
  - `README_RU.md` synced to English README (`/v1/ws`, `/metrics` row,
    `125 unit tests`, INT8 section rewritten for the no-feature-flag
    behaviour shipped in v0.9.0).
  - `docs/deployment.md` rate-limiter version string corrected
    (v0.8.0, not v0.7.3).
  - `CLAUDE.md` drops references to the now-deleted
    `tests/server_integration.rs`.

### CI

- **`cargo audit` job** switched from `cargo install cargo-audit --locked`
  (rebuilt on every PR, ~90 s) to the prebuilt `rustsec/audit-check@v2`
  action — same checker, same advisory source.
- **`soak.yml` cache key** scoped by profile (`-release`) so nightly soak
  runs don't evict the `target/` that `ci.yml` populates.

### Dependencies

- Removed redundant `tracing-subscriber` entry from `[dev-dependencies]`
  (already declared in `[dependencies]`; cargo exposes it to integration
  tests automatically).

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **CI: minisign signing step accepts password non-interactively** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). v0.9.1 release job got through the build + SBOM + provenance steps but failed at `Sign tarballs + SHA256SUMS with minisign` because `rsign2 sign -W` interprets `-W` as "write signature" (not "password"), so the process still prompted for a passphrase and rejected the key with `Wrong password for that key`. Switched to the apt-installed `minisign` binary, which reads the passphrase on stdin when stdout is non-TTY — a well-supported CI pattern.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **CI: install `protoc` on every cargo-build job** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.github/workflows/soak.yml`). v0.9.0 rollout failed in the release workflow because `prost-build` shells out to `protoc` and the GitHub-hosted `macos-14` + `ubuntu-latest` runners don't carry it. Every cargo-build-facing job now runs `arduino/setup-protoc@v3` right after `rust-toolchain`. No source change — the v0.9.0 binaries would have been bit-identical if the CI had succeeded; v0.9.1 is purely a rebuild.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-21

_Stable release promoting `0.9.0-rc.2` + the follow-up supply-chain
lockdown (vendored ONNX protobuf, in-tree token-bucket rate limiter,
in-tree Prometheus encoder, CycloneDX SBOM, SLSA provenance, minisign
release signing). See the [Unreleased] rows moved in below for the
full rollup; no functional regressions since rc.2._


### Added

- **Vendored ONNX protobuf schema + native codegen** (V1-10 follow-up, `proto/onnx.proto`, `build.rs`, `src/onnx_proto.rs`). `proto/onnx.proto` is copied verbatim from github.com/onnx/onnx (MIT-licensed, 1 000 LoC) and regenerated on every build by `prost-build 0.13` — replacing the unmaintained `onnx-pb 0.1.4` crate (last published 2020, transitively pinned to `prost 0.6`). Requires `protoc` in `PATH` at build time (`brew install protobuf`, `apt install protobuf-compiler`); see `build.rs` for the friendly failure message. Closes `RUSTSEC-2021-0073`: the advisory targeted `prost-types 0.6`'s `From<Timestamp> for SystemTime` path, which no longer ships in our dependency graph — the ignore block is gone from `deny.toml` and `.cargo/audit.toml`.
- **Custom Prometheus text encoder** (`src/server/metrics.rs`, replaces `metrics-exporter-prometheus`). ~280-line `MetricsRegistry` that serialises counters + histograms in Prometheus 0.0.4 exposition format. We only expose two metrics (`gigastt_http_requests_total`, `gigastt_http_request_duration_seconds`), so a full Recorder-trait registry was overkill — the new `HttpMetricsMiddleware` calls `registry.counter_inc(...)` / `registry.histogram_record(...)` directly, no global recorder, no `metrics` / `metrics-util` / `indexmap` / `quanta` transitives. 125 lib tests pass (+ 7 new metrics tests covering counter increment, histogram bucket cumulativity, label ordering, label escaping, empty labels, sum tracking, and empty-registry rendering).
- **Nightly soak + load CI** (V1-09). New `.github/workflows/soak.yml` runs `cargo test --test soak_test -- --ignored` at 03:17 UTC daily (plus `workflow_dispatch` for on-demand checks), reusing the main-CI model cache so regressions in pool drift / descriptor leaks / RSS growth surface outside the fast-feedback envelope.
- **`docs/deployment.md`: rate-limiter & X-Forwarded-For section** (V1-11). The published nginx recipe used `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`, which appends client-supplied headers, and the Caddy recipe did not forward the real peer at all — operators who turned on `--rate-limit-per-minute` were running a defence attackers could trivially bypass. Both recipes now overwrite the header with `$remote_addr` / `{remote_host}`, and a new section explains why it's not optional.

### Changed

- **Custom per-IP token-bucket rate limiter (drops `tower_governor`)** (`src/server/rate_limit.rs`, `src/server/mod.rs`, `Cargo.toml`). Replaced the `tower_governor = "0.7"` dependency with a focused ~150-line implementation tailored to gigastt's single middleware hook. Drops `tower_governor`, `governor`, `forwarded-header-value`, and `nonzero_ext` from `Cargo.lock`; `dashmap` is promoted from transitive to direct so the lock-free shard map stays explicit. Refill math preserves the V1-06 formula (`refill_per_ms = rpm / 60_000`) — covered by both the existing `test_rate_limit_interval_formula` and the new `test_rate_limiter_refill_formula_matches_v1_06`. IP extraction still honours the V1-11 trust boundary (first hop of `X-Forwarded-For`, then `X-Real-IP`, then `ConnectInfo`). Memory is bounded by a `tokio::spawn` eviction task that tracks `shutdown_root`, not the old `std::thread::spawn` GC thread that leaked on shutdown.
- **`Engine::create_state` accepts `diarization_enabled` unconditionally** (V1-08, `src/inference/mod.rs`). The parameter used to be gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "diarization")]`, so the same public API mutated between feature builds — `src/lib.rs`'s doctest compiled only with `--features diarization`, and external consumers had to wrap every call site in their own gate. The bool is now always present; without the feature a `warn!` is emitted if the caller asked for diarization so the contract mismatch stays observable.
- **INT8 quantization is now always available and auto-invoked** (V1-10, `src/main.rs`, `src/quantize.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `Cargo.toml`). The native Rust quantization pipeline no longer hides behind the `quantize` Cargo feature — `onnx-pb` and `prost` are now unconditional dependencies and `pub mod quantize` is always compiled in. `gigastt download` and `gigastt serve` both call `ensure_int8_encoder` after `model::ensure_model`, producing the `v3_e2e_rnnt_encoder_int8.onnx` artifact on first run (~2 min one-time). The `quantize` feature is retained as a documented no-op so existing `cargo install gigastt --features quantize` invocations keep working.
- **New `--skip-quantize` flag on `serve` and `download`** (V1-10, env `GIGASTT_SKIP_QUANTIZE=1`, default off). Opt out of the automatic quantization step when debugging against the FP32 encoder.

### Fixed

- **Model download TOCTOU** (V1-01, `src/model/mod.rs`). `download_file` used to stream each `v3_e2e_rnnt_*.onnx` blob directly into its final path, compute SHA-256 afterwards, and `remove_file` on mismatch. Between the last `write` and the hash comparison another process (or a second `ensure_model` call on restart) could observe an unverified file under the canonical name — and a crash in that window left a corrupt artefact that `model_files_exist()` would later accept, skipping re-download on next boot. Downloads now stream into `<filename>.partial`, SHA-256 is computed against the partial, and only after verification does `std::fs::rename` (atomic on the same filesystem) promote it to the final path. Mismatch or crash leaves nothing under the final name. Stale `.partial` files from previous crashed runs are deleted before the new download begins.
- **Speaker diarization model lacked SHA-256 verification** (V1-02, `src/model/mod.rs`, `--features diarization`). `ensure_speaker_model` streamed `wespeaker_resnet34.onnx` (26 535 549 bytes, from `onnx-community/wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM`) straight to its final path with no integrity check, so a tampered mirror or corrupted redirect was loaded into `ort::Session` without complaint — the same failure class as V1-01. The downloader now stages into `<name>.partial`, verifies SHA-256 against the new `SPEAKER_MODEL_SHA256 = "3955447b0499dc9e0a4541a895df08b03c69098eba4e56c02b5603e9f7f4fcbb"` constant (pinned to the 2026-04-20 HuggingFace copy), and only then atomically renames.
- **Odd-length PCM16 WebSocket frames corrupted subsequent frames** (V1-25, `src/server/mod.rs`). `handle_binary_frame` called `chunks_exact(2)` directly, silently dropping a trailing odd byte whenever a client split their PCM16 stream on an odd boundary. The dropped byte put the following frame 1 sample out of phase with the audio decoded so far — subtle in the waveform, measurable in the inference output, hard to diagnose. A per-connection `pending_byte: Option<u8>` now carries the remainder across frames (prepended before the next `chunks_exact`, re-stashed if the combined length is again odd).
- **`tests/e2e_rest.rs::test_rest_large_body_rss_within_budget` was mis-sized**. The helper call `generate_wav(150, 16000)` produced a 4.6 MiB WAV but the test asserted `> 30 MiB` and panicked before running. Regenerated at `generate_wav(300, 16000)` (9.6 MiB) with a budget that now accounts for the PCM16 → f32 expansion (2× wav.len() + 40 MiB slack).
- **`deny.toml` / `.cargo/audit.toml` justification for `RUSTSEC-2021-0073`** (V1-10 follow-up). `onnx-pb` has no newer release on crates.io (0.1.4 is the only published version) and the closest modern replacement (`onnx-protobuf` on the `protobuf` crate family) is broken at its current release. The advisory stays ignored with a refreshed rationale documenting that the affected `From<Timestamp> for SystemTime` code path is unreachable from our quantization pipeline.

## [0.9.0-rc.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **`test_rest_oversized_body_rejected` e2e assertion** (`tests/e2e_errors.rs`). The rc.1 assertion insisted on a JSON body with `code="payload_too_large"`, but `axum::DefaultBodyLimit` returns a plain-text 413 when `Content-Length` exceeds the cap — the middleware layer fires before the handler's defence-in-depth guard. The V1-22 contract (strict 413 status) is unchanged; the JSON-body check is now conditional on the handler-layer guard being the one that fires. The rc.1 binaries are functionally correct.

## [0.9.0-rc.1] - 2026-04-20

_Release candidate for v0.9.0 — bundles five P0 fixes (V1-03, V1-04, V1-05, V1-06, V1-07) plus two supporting items (V1-21 `PoolGuard` Drop, V1-22 strict 413 assertion) from `specs/prod-readiness-v1.0.md`. RuntimeLimits gained two fields (`max_session_secs`, `shutdown_drain_secs`) — external callers constructing the struct literally must update their call sites. SessionPool checkout API replaced (`checkout() -> PoolGuard`)._

### Added

- **Graceful WebSocket / SSE drain on shutdown** (V1-03; closes `specs/prod-readiness-v1.0.md` P0). `axum::serve.with_graceful_shutdown` only tracks the HTTP router — WebSocket upgrades and SSE `spawn_blocking` tasks used to outlive the signal, so clients lost their `Final` frame on deploy. New `CancellationToken` + `TaskTracker` cascade through every handler; on SIGTERM each live session flushes, emits an empty-if-needed `Final`, and closes with `Close(1001 Going Away)`. After `axum::serve` returns, `run_with_config` waits up to `shutdown_drain_secs` for the tracker to drain.
- **Wall-clock max-session cap** (V1-04; closes `specs/prod-readiness-v1.0.md` P0). `idle_timeout` is reset on every frame, so a client that streams silence every 100 ms held a `SessionTriplet` forever. New `max_session_secs` limit closes the session with `Close(1008 Policy Violation)` + `Error { code: "max_session_duration_exceeded" }`. `0` disables the cap (not recommended).
- **CLI flags.**
  - `--max-session-secs` / `GIGASTT_MAX_SESSION_SECS` (default `3600`).
  - `--shutdown-drain-secs` / `GIGASTT_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_SECS` (default `10`, clamped to `>= 1`).
- **`tests/e2e_shutdown.rs` re-enabled in CI** with four additional assertions: `test_shutdown_ws_emits_final_and_close`, `test_shutdown_sse_stream_terminates_cleanly`, `test_max_session_duration_cap`, and `test_shutdown_during_pool_saturation_returns_503_not_500`. The main-push e2e job now runs the full `--test e2e_rest --test e2e_ws --test e2e_errors --test e2e_shutdown` matrix.
- **`docs/runbook.md`** — rollback + on-call guidance for the new knobs.
- **`docs/deployment.md`** — `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` recommendation for k8s / docker-compose.

### Fixed

- **Per-IP rate-limiter math (V1-06, `src/server/mod.rs`).** `(rate_limit_per_minute / 60).max(1)` truncated every value below 60 rpm to a 1 rps refill (= 60 rpm), so a defender setting `--rate-limit-per-minute 10` actually allowed 60 rpm — 6× weaker than declared. Switched to `tower_governor`'s `per_millisecond(60_000 / rpm)`, which preserves sub-second precision down to 1 rpm and clamps the upper bound at 60 000 rpm with a `warn!`. The startup log now includes the resolved `interval_ms` alongside `rpm` for diagnostics.
- **Session pool panic + unfairness (V1-07, V1-21, `src/inference/mod.rs`).** Replaced the `tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver` behind a `tokio::sync::Mutex` with a lock-free `async_channel`. The new `Pool<T>` (alias `SessionPool = Pool<SessionTriplet>`) is FIFO under contention, exposes `close()` so graceful shutdown wakes every waiter with `PoolError::Closed` instead of panicking via `.expect("Pool sender dropped")`, and returns a `PoolGuard` whose `Drop` impl auto-checks-in the triplet on panic unwind. Server shutdown now wires `engine.pool.close()` into the shutdown future, and the REST handlers translate `PoolError::Closed` into a distinct 503 `pool_closed` response (separate from the 503 `timeout` for the 30 s checkout deadline).
- **REST oversized-body rejection is now strict 413** (V1-22, `tests/e2e_errors.rs::test_rest_oversized_body_rejected`). Handlers in `src/server/http.rs` now add an explicit `body.len() > limits.body_limit_bytes → 413 payload_too_large` guard as defence-in-depth behind `DefaultBodyLimit`, and the e2e assertion upgrades from `!= 200` to a strict `== 413` with `code="payload_too_large"`.

### Changed

- `RuntimeLimits` gained `max_session_secs: u64` and `shutdown_drain_secs: u64`. External callers constructing `RuntimeLimits` literally will need to add the new fields (pre-1.0 minor bump — acceptable).
- `http::AppState` carries `shutdown: CancellationToken` and `tracker: TaskTracker`.
- `handle_ws_inner` switches from a bare `timeout(idle, source.next())` to a `biased;` `select!` with explicit cancel + deadline branches.
- `/v1/transcribe/stream` SSE task now runs on `TaskTracker::spawn_blocking` and polls the shutdown token between chunks so SIGTERM aborts long transcriptions instead of waiting them out.
- `SessionPool::{checkout, checkin, blocking_checkin}` replaced by `SessionPool::checkout() -> Result<PoolGuard, PoolError>`. The guard `Deref`s to `SessionTriplet` and auto-checks-in on drop. For `'static` consumers (`spawn_blocking`), call `guard.into_owned()` to get a `(SessionTriplet, OwnedReservation)` pair and return the triplet via `OwnedReservation::checkin(triplet)`.
- **Zero-copy REST upload decode path** (V1-05, `src/inference/audio.rs`, `src/inference/mod.rs`, `src/server/http.rs`). The `/v1/transcribe` and `/v1/transcribe/stream` handlers used to call `body.to_vec()` on the incoming `axum::body::Bytes`, then `decode_audio_bytes` cloned that `Vec<u8>` into a `std::io::Cursor`, and symphonia decoded the PCM into another `Vec<f32>` — four concurrent copies of the upload were in RAM at peak. A 4× concurrent upload of a 10-minute WAV held ~1 GiB transiently and could OOM on a 1 GiB container. New path: `bytes::Bytes` flows end-to-end via a crate-private `BytesMediaSource` that implements `Read + Seek + MediaSource` directly on the refcounted buffer; new `decode_audio_bytes_shared(Bytes)` and `Engine::transcribe_bytes_shared(Bytes, _)` entry points. The legacy `decode_audio_bytes(&[u8])` / `Engine::transcribe_bytes(&[u8], _)` functions remain as thin shims (one `Bytes::copy_from_slice` for non-REST callers), so no public API breakage.
- **Incremental 10-minute duration cap** inside the decode loop (V1-05). The check used to fire only after the full PCM buffer was assembled, so a malformed or hostile upload could still allocate hundreds of MiB before being rejected. Now each packet's samples are accumulated against a precomputed sample budget and the decoder bails out on the first packet that breaks the cap.

### Dependencies

- Promoted `tokio-util = { version = "0.7", features = ["rt"] }` from transitive to direct. Dev-deps gained `tracing-subscriber` so integration tests can surface server logs on failure.
- `async-channel = "2"` (transitive pieces — `concurrent-queue`, `event-listener` — were already in the graph).
- Added explicit `bytes = "1"` pin (previously transitive via `axum` / `tokio`) — makes the zero-copy contract between axum and symphonia visible in `Cargo.toml`.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **CoreML / CUDA startup crash on macOS 26+ (`Unable to serialize model as it contains compiled nodes`)** — `src/inference/mod.rs` previously called `.with_optimized_model_path(...)` after registering the CoreML / CUDA execution providers. Those EPs replace parts of the graph with compiled nodes that cannot be re-serialized as ONNX, so ORT aborted session creation before the server could bind. Regression introduced in v0.5.0. The optimized-ONNX cache path is removed from both EP paths; the CoreML block keeps its dedicated `coreml_cache/` (compiled-model cache) and the CUDA EP keeps its internal caches. Cost: ~1–2 s additional cold start. Benefit: `gigastt serve --features coreml` works again on macOS 14+.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 7). Enabled via `--metrics` (env `GIGASTT_METRICS=1`); off by default. Exposes
  - `gigastt_http_requests_total{method,path,status}` (counter)
  - `gigastt_http_request_duration_seconds{method,path}` (histogram).
  The endpoint sits behind the Origin allowlist and (when configured) the per-IP rate limiter. Recorder install is tolerant of double-install: emits a warning and keeps the server running instead of failing.
- **Per-IP rate limiting** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 17). `--rate-limit-per-minute N` (env `GIGASTT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`) + `--rate-limit-burst N` (env `GIGASTT_RATE_LIMIT_BURST`). Off by default. Applies to `/v1/*` and `/v1/ws`; `/health` is exempt. Implemented with `tower_governor` using `SmartIpKeyExtractor`. Returns 429 on violations. A background task evicts expired token buckets every 60 s.
- **`docs/deployment.md`** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 20). Reverse-proxy recipes for Caddy and nginx (certbot + `auth_basic`), Origin header behaviour, Docker binding strategy, health-check target, and a hardening checklist for remote deployments.

### Changed

- `ServerConfig` gained a `metrics_enabled: bool` field; `RuntimeLimits` gained `rate_limit_per_minute` + `rate_limit_burst`.
- `http::AppState` now carries `metrics_handle: Option<PrometheusHandle>`.
- The axum router splits into `/health` (public) and a `protected` sub-router for `/v1/*`, `/ws` alias, `/v1/ws`, and `/metrics` — rate limiter is layered on the protected branch only.

### Dependencies

- `tower_governor = "0.7"`
- `metrics = "0.24"`
- `metrics-exporter-prometheus = "0.17"` (default-features off)

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **`cargo-deny` licenses + advisories** (`deny.toml`).
  - Added `CDLA-Permissive-2.0` to the license allowlist — `webpki-root-certs` (the Mozilla CA bundle) publishes under CDLA; behaves like MIT for our use.
  - Added `RUSTSEC-2021-0073` to `ignore` in `[advisories]`. `prost-types 0.6.1` is a build-time transitive of `onnx-pb` under the `quantize` feature; the affected `From<Timestamp> for SystemTime` path is not reached by our pipeline.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **`cargo-deny` CI job** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — removed the trailing `arguments: licenses advisories bans sources`. The installed `cargo-deny` on stable-musl interpreted them as subcommands and failed with `unrecognized subcommand 'licenses'`. Default `check` already covers licenses, advisories, bans, and sources.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Configurable runtime limits** (`gigastt::server::RuntimeLimits`, closes `specs/todo.md` item 6). Three knobs exposed via CLI + environment variables:
  - `--idle-timeout-secs` / `GIGASTT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` — WebSocket idle timeout (default 300).
  - `--ws-frame-max-bytes` / `GIGASTT_WS_FRAME_MAX_BYTES` — max WS frame / message (default 512 KiB).
  - `--body-limit-bytes` / `GIGASTT_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` — max REST body (default 50 MiB).
  Delivered via a new `RuntimeLimits` field on `ServerConfig` and `http::AppState`; TOML config file support stays for a follow-up.
- **Canonical WebSocket path `/v1/ws`** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 11). Versioned path aligned with REST; legacy `/ws` remains as an alias with a warn-level deprecation log on every upgrade. Removal planned for v1.0.
- **`diarization` capability in `GET /v1/models`** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 12). Mirrors the WebSocket `Ready` field so clients can probe capabilities without opening a WS.
- **Docker `GIGASTT_BAKE_MODEL=1` build-arg** (closes `specs/todo.md` item 10). When set, a dedicated `model-fetcher` stage runs `gigastt download` during image build and the runtime stage copies the model into `/home/gigastt/.gigastt/models/`. Default (`0`) preserves the slim image.
- **`cargo deny check` in CI + `deny.toml`** (closes first half of `specs/todo.md` item 14 — SBOM stays for later). Enforces license allowlist + advisory scan + crates.io-only source + wildcard ban on every PR via `EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2`.

### Changed

- `http::AppState` now carries `limits: RuntimeLimits` alongside `engine`; `handle_ws_inner` takes `&RuntimeLimits` so the idle timeout is no longer hard-coded.
- `DefaultBodyLimit::max` in the Axum router reads from `config.limits.body_limit_bytes` instead of the old `50 * 1024 * 1024` literal.
- `ws_handler` reads `ws_frame_max_bytes` from `AppState` instead of baking 512 KiB into the code path.

### Notes

- `RuntimeLimits`, `ServerConfig::local`, and `run_with_config` are public — downstream embedders can construct a fully customised server without CLI.
- Murmur remains on v0.6.0: no wire protocol break, new limits are additive + opt-in.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **`handle_ws_inner` refactor** (`src/server/mod.rs`) — extracted three frame handlers (`handle_binary_frame`, `handle_configure_message`, `handle_stop_message`) and a `send_server_message` helper; the session loop is now ~60 lines with a single `FrameOutcome` dispatch. Behavior unchanged (same tests + clippy clean); reduces future risk when touching the hot path.

### Added

- **Integration test for origin middleware** (`src/server/mod.rs::tests::test_origin_middleware_integration`) — spins a minimal axum router with `origin_middleware` on a real port and verifies: `/health` is exempt, cross-origin `/v1/*` returns 403 `origin_denied`, loopback Origin is echoed into `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, no-Origin requests pass through, and `localhost.evil.example.com` DNS-continuation attempts are denied.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Origin allowlist middleware.** Cross-origin requests from non-loopback pages are denied by default across `/v1/*` and `/ws`; loopback origins (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`) always pass. New CLI flags:
  - `--allow-origin <URL>` (repeatable) — exact-match, case-insensitive Origin allowlist.
  - `--cors-allow-any` — legacy `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` behaviour, opt-in.
  `/health` remains free of Origin checks for monitoring / Docker `HEALTHCHECK`.
- **`--bind-all` guard.** `gigastt serve` refuses non-loopback `--host` values (`0.0.0.0`, LAN IPs, …) unless `--bind-all` is passed or `GIGASTT_ALLOW_BIND_ANY=1` is set. Both `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.cuda` now pass `--bind-all` in their `CMD` line.
- **`Retry-After` on pool saturation.**
  - REST `/v1/transcribe` and `/v1/transcribe/stream` return HTTP 503 with a `Retry-After: 30` header (RFC 9110 §10.2.3) and `retry_after_ms: 30000` in the JSON body.
  - WebSocket `ServerMessage::Error` gained an optional `retry_after_ms` field (omitted from JSON when absent, preserving backward compatibility); the pool-timeout path at connect emits `retry_after_ms: 30000`.
- **`gigastt::server::{ServerConfig, OriginPolicy, run_with_config}`** — new public API for programmatic startup with explicit origin policy.

### Changed

- **Default cross-origin posture is now deny.** Previous behaviour (wildcard CORS + non-local Origin only warned about) is preserved behind `--cors-allow-any`. Browser integrations hitting the server from a non-loopback page must either add their origin via `--allow-origin` or run the server with `--cors-allow-any`.

### Security

- Closes `specs/todo.md` P1 items 4, 5, 8, 9. Reduces the risk that a malicious webpage can drive-by-connect to the local transcription server and exfiltrate microphone audio.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-17

### Security

- **`rustls-webpki` 0.103.10 → 0.103.12** (`Cargo.lock`) — resolves RUSTSEC-2026-0098 (name constraints for URI names incorrectly accepted) and RUSTSEC-2026-0099 (name constraints accepted for certificates asserting a wildcard name). Pulled in transitively via `reqwest → hyper-rustls → rustls`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **CI clippy** (`src/model/mod.rs:29`) — replaced manual `if self.total > 0` division guard with `checked_div`, satisfying Rust 1.95's new `clippy::manual_checked_ops` lint that broke CI on v0.5.1.
- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — removed the `linux-x86_64-cuda` matrix entry: `Jimver/cuda-toolkit@v0.2.19` cannot resolve the `cuda-nvcc-12-4` / `cuda-cudart-12-4` packages on `ubuntu-latest`. Tracked for re-enabling in `specs/todo.md`. Until then CUDA users build from source.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Release automation** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — tag-triggered matrix workflow that produces `gigastt-<ver>-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` (coreml), `gigastt-<ver>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` (cpu), `gigastt-<ver>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cuda.tar.gz`, per-asset `.sha256` files, and aggregated `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Replaces ad-hoc manual uploads that previously broke SHA-pinned downstream clients.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — release checklist and contribution guidelines, including an explicit prohibition on manual `gh release upload` of binary assets.
- **`examples/bun_client.ts`, `examples/go_client.go`, `examples/KotlinClient.kt`** — WebSocket client samples in Go, Kotlin (OkHttp), and Bun-native TypeScript.
- **`specs/todo.md` + `specs/plan.md`** — 20-item follow-up list from the v0.5.0 critique, ranked P0/P1/P2 and sequenced into six phases through v1.0.0.

### Fixed

- **WebSocket pool recovery after inference panic** (`src/server/mod.rs`) — a panic inside `process_chunk` used to leak the `SessionTriplet` and permanently shrink the pool. Now the blocking task owns the state and triplet, wraps the inner call in `catch_unwind(AssertUnwindSafe(_))`, and returns both unconditionally. On panic the WS session sends an `inference_panic` error, resets its streaming state, and continues instead of tearing down.
- **`clippy::never_loop`** in `tests/e2e_errors.rs` (two occurrences) — replaced the single-iteration `while let` drains with a `tokio::time::timeout(_).await` call, unblocking stricter lint levels.

### Removed

- **`scripts/quantize.py`** — superseded by native Rust quantization (`gigastt quantize --features quantize`).
- **`examples/js_client.mjs`** — replaced by `examples/bun_client.ts`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Native Rust INT8 quantization** (`--features quantize`) — `gigastt quantize` command replaces `scripts/quantize.py`. Per-channel symmetric QDQ format, hardened against shared weights and malformed tensors.
- **Auto-quantize on download/serve** — automatically creates INT8 encoder when built with `--features quantize`. Prints hint otherwise.
- **`GET /v1/models` endpoint** — returns model info: encoder type (int8/fp32), vocab size, pool status, supported formats and sample rates.
- **`--log-level` CLI option** — global flag for all commands (`gigastt --log-level debug serve`), replaces `RUST_LOG`-only config.
- **`--pool-size` CLI option** — configurable concurrent inference sessions for `serve` command.
- **`Engine::is_int8()`** method exposes encoder quantization status.
- **PrepackedWeights** — shared ONNX Runtime weight memory across session pool (reduced memory footprint).
- **Inference instrumentation** — encoder/decoder timing logged at info level.
- **Russian README** (`README_RU.md`) with language switcher.
- **CI `cargo fmt --check`** job for format enforcement.

### Changed

- **WER benchmark** verified on 993 Golos samples (4991 words): FP32 10.5%, INT8 10.4% — 0% degradation confirmed.
- **README** updated with verified metrics: WER 10.4%, latency ~700ms, memory ~560MB. Expanded comparison table.
- **Decoder optimization** — cached decoder output during blank runs (86% decoder call reduction).
- **Optimized model cache** directory for pre-compiled ONNX models.

### Fixed

- **Server hardening** — WS pool checkout timeout (30s), REST `catch_unwind` for panic recovery, removed `unwrap`/`expect` in handlers.
- **Security** — upgraded `tokio-tungstenite` 0.24→0.28, resolving RUSTSEC-2026-0097 (`rand` 0.8.5 unsoundness).
- **CI stability** — e2e tests serialized with `--test-threads=1` (prevents OOM), shutdown tests excluded (require graceful connection termination), SSE tests resilient to non-speech audio.
- **Benchmark overflow** — `number_to_words` handles numbers > 999,999.
- **Dockerfiles** updated to Rust 1.85+ for edition 2024 support.
- **Audio decode refactor** — extracted shared inner function, eliminated ~80 line duplication.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Comprehensive e2e test infrastructure** — 28 new tests across 7 files:
  - `tests/e2e_rest.rs` (8 tests): health, transcribe, SSE streaming, error paths
  - `tests/e2e_ws.rs` (9 tests): WebSocket protocol — ready, audio, stop, configure, malformed JSON, disconnect, concurrency
  - `tests/e2e_errors.rs` (5 tests): oversized body/frame rejection, pool saturation (503), idle timeout
  - `tests/e2e_shutdown.rs` (2 tests): graceful shutdown during active WS/SSE sessions
  - `tests/load_test.rs` (3 tests): 4 concurrent WS/REST, burst 20 connections
  - `tests/soak_test.rs` (1 test): continuous WS cycling (configurable via `GIGASTT_SOAK_DURATION_SECS`)
- **Shared test helpers** (`tests/common/mod.rs`): `start_server` with clean shutdown, `wait_for_ready` with exponential backoff, WAV generation, WebSocket connect helpers.
- **`server::run_with_shutdown()`** — accepts optional `oneshot::Receiver<()>` for programmatic server shutdown (used by tests; `run()` unchanged).
- **CI feature matrix** — split into 7 jobs: clippy, unit tests, build-coreml, build-cuda, build-diarization, e2e tests (main push only with cached model), security audit.

### Changed

- CI workflow restructured: PRs get fast feedback (unit + clippy + feature builds), main push adds full e2e suite with ~850MB cached model (OS-independent cache key).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-13

### Removed

- **`dirs` dependency** — replaced with `env::var("HOME")` / `USERPROFILE` (~10 lines).
- **`indicatif` dependency** — replaced with simple stderr progress output (~50 transitive deps removed).
- **`tempfile` from production deps** — HTTP handlers decode audio from memory via `Cursor<Vec<u8>>` (faster, no disk I/O). Kept in dev-dependencies for tests.
- **`async-stream` dependency** — replaced with `futures_util::stream::unfold`.
- **`tower-http` dependency** — replaced with axum's built-in `DefaultBodyLimit`.

### Added

- `decode_audio_bytes()` — decode audio from in-memory bytes without temp files.
- `Engine::transcribe_bytes()` — transcribe from byte buffer directly.
- Security audit job in CI workflow (`cargo audit`).
- Non-root user in Dockerfiles (hardened containers).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Diarization module no longer depends on internal `ort_err()` helper — uses `anyhow::Context` instead. Module is now self-contained and ready for future crate extraction.

### Fixed

- Centroid re-normalization after running average update (prevents speaker clustering drift).
- Semaphore timeout (30s) on HTTP endpoints prevents DoS via hanging requests.
- SSE semaphore permit held for stream lifetime (was dropped before stream consumed).
- SSE inference wrapped in `spawn_blocking` (no longer blocks async runtime).
- Error messages sanitized at HTTP API boundary (no internal path/model leakage).
- Speaker count capped at 64 (`MAX_SPEAKERS`) with graceful fallback.
- Cosine similarity zero-norm check uses epsilon (1e-8) instead of exact float equality.
- Request body dropped after temp file write (reduces peak memory ~2x for large files).
- Configure message rejected after first audio frame (`configure_too_late` error).
- WebSocket idle timeout (300s) disconnects silent clients.
- Unnecessary `samples_16k_copy` allocation skipped when diarization disabled at runtime.
- Async `tokio::fs::write` replaces blocking `std::fs::write` in HTTP handlers.
- `tokio-tungstenite` moved to dev-dependencies (unused in production code).
- `hound` dependency removed (unused).
- CLAUDE.md and README.md updated: test counts, architecture tree, WebSocket URL `/ws`, REST API docs, version references.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Cross-platform support** via compile-time Cargo feature flags:
  - `--features coreml`: macOS ARM64 (CoreML + Neural Engine) — existing behavior
  - `--features cuda`: Linux x86_64 (NVIDIA CUDA 12+)
  - Default (no features): CPU-only, compiles on any platform
  - `compile_error!` guard prevents enabling both `coreml` and `cuda`
- **Flexible sample rate**: `ClientMessage::Configure { sample_rate }` lets clients declare input rate (8kHz, 16kHz, 24kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz). Default 48kHz for backward compatibility.
- **Polyphase FIR resampler** (rubato `SincFixedIn`) replaces linear interpolation — significantly better audio quality.
- **`ServerMessage::Ready`** extended with `supported_rates` field (list of accepted sample rates).
- **HTTP REST API** via axum (single port serves HTTP + WebSocket):
  - `GET /health` — health check for monitoring and Docker HEALTHCHECK
  - `POST /v1/transcribe` — upload audio file, receive full JSON transcript
  - `POST /v1/transcribe/stream` — upload audio file, receive SSE stream of partial/final results
  - `GET /ws` — WebSocket streaming (existing protocol, new path)
- **Speaker diarization** (optional, `--features diarization`):
  - WeSpeaker ResNet34 ONNX model (26.5MB, 256-dim embeddings, 16kHz)
  - Online incremental clustering (cosine similarity, configurable threshold)
  - `WordInfo.speaker: Option<u32>` field identifies speakers per word
  - `Configure { diarization: true }` enables per-session
  - `gigastt download --diarization` fetches speaker model separately
  - MAX_SPEAKERS=64 cap with graceful fallback to closest match
- **`Dockerfile.cuda`** — multi-stage CUDA build with `nvidia/cuda:12.6.3-cudnn-runtime`
- **GitHub Actions CI** matrix: macOS (CoreML) + Linux (CPU) in parallel
- **Semaphore timeout** (30s) on HTTP endpoints prevents DoS via hanging requests
- **WebSocket idle timeout** (300s) disconnects silent clients
- **Configure guard** — server rejects `Configure` after first audio frame

### Changed

- **Server migrated from raw tokio-tungstenite to axum** — single port serves HTTP routes + WebSocket upgrade
- **WebSocket endpoint moved to `/ws`** (was root `/`). Clients must connect to `ws://host:port/ws`.
- **`ClientMessage::Configure.sample_rate`** changed from `u32` to `Option<u32>` to support partial configuration (sample rate only, diarization only, or both).
- **Dockerfile** CPU build no longer uses `--no-default-features` (default features are now empty = CPU).
- **SSE inference** runs in `spawn_blocking` (no longer blocks async runtime).
- **Error responses** in HTTP handlers sanitized — generic messages to clients, details logged server-side.
- `tokio-tungstenite` moved from production to dev-dependencies (only used in integration tests).
- `hound` dependency removed (unused; all audio decoding via symphonia).

### Fixed

- **Centroid drift in speaker clustering** — centroids re-normalized after running average update.
- **Cosine similarity** zero-norm check uses epsilon (1e-8) instead of exact float equality.
- **SSE semaphore permit** held for stream lifetime (was dropped before stream consumed).
- **HTTP body memory** — request body dropped after temp file write, reducing peak memory usage.
- **Async file I/O** — `tokio::fs::write` replaces blocking `std::fs::write` in HTTP handlers.

### Breaking Changes

- WebSocket path changed: `/` → `/ws`. Update client connection URLs.
- `Configure.sample_rate` type changed: `u32` → `Option<u32>`. Existing JSON `{"type":"configure","sample_rate":8000}` still works via `#[serde(default)]`.
- Default `cargo build` (no features) now produces CPU-only binary. macOS users must explicitly add `--features coreml`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- `GigasttError` enum (`error` module) with variants: `ModelLoad`, `Inference`, `InvalidAudio`, `Io` — enables `match`-based error handling.
- `#[non_exhaustive]` on all public structs and enums — future additions are non-breaking.
- Comprehensive `///` rustdoc on all public types, functions, fields, and constants.
- Crate-level documentation with quick-start examples in `lib.rs`.
- Stress tests for NaN/infinity audio samples, empty inputs, and buffer boundary conditions.

### Fixed

- Potential panic on odd-length WebSocket binary frames (`chunks_exact(2)` now drops trailing byte with warning).
- Non-finite audio samples (NaN, infinity) in `resample()` replaced with zeros instead of propagating.

### Breaking Changes

- `Engine::load()`, `Engine::process_chunk()`, and `Engine::transcribe_file()` return `Result<T, GigasttError>` instead of `anyhow::Result<T>`.
- All public structs/enums are `#[non_exhaustive]` — external struct literal construction requires constructor methods.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- Partial transcripts with real-time streaming via WebSocket.
- Endpointing detection (~600ms silence triggers finalization).
- Per-word timestamps (`WordInfo.start`, `WordInfo.end`) relative to stream start.
- Per-word confidence scores (`WordInfo.confidence`) averaged over BPE tokens.
- CoreML execution provider for macOS ARM64 (Neural Engine + CPU).
- INT8 quantized encoder support (`v3_e2e_rnnt_encoder_int8.onnx`, ~4x smaller, ~43% faster).
- CoreML model cache directory (`~/.gigastt/models/coreml_cache/`).
- Docker multi-stage build (`Dockerfile`).
- Python quantization script (`scripts/quantize.py`).

### Changed

- Audio pipeline: accept 48kHz from WebSocket clients, resample to 16kHz internally.
- Encoder output shape handling: channels-first `[1, 768, T]` format.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- GigaAM v3 e2e_rnnt inference engine with ONNX Runtime.
- WebSocket server (tokio + tungstenite) for streaming audio.
- CLI: `serve`, `download`, `transcribe` commands.
- HuggingFace model auto-download (`istupakov/gigaam-v3-onnx`).
- BPE tokenizer (1025 tokens).
- Mel spectrogram (64 bins, FFT=320, hop=160, HTK).
- RNN-T greedy decode loop.
- Multi-format audio support: WAV, MP3, M4A/AAC, OGG/Vorbis, FLAC (via symphonia).
- 39 unit tests (tokenizer, features, decode, inference, protocol).
